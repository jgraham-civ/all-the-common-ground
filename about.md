subtitle: A bit about my background and the content of my blog

At the risk of undermining everything you’ve just read on my homepage; I should declare that I have my own specialist areas. My background is in biology and medicine, and I have particular interest in infectious diseases, data science and genetics. That is why the name of this blog abbreviates to ATCG – the four compounds which make up DNA.  

Most of my blog posts will talk about developments in these subject areas, but always considering their applications beyond the lab; global issues never fit neatly within one field of study.
