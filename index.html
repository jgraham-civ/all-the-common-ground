title: All the Common Ground
---

Our structures of education like to divide human knowledge into fields. Often, these fields are further subdivided; philosophy within the humanities, ethics within philosophy. The same applies to professional disciplines; consider a doctor specialising in surgery, or a mechanic specialising in aircraft.  
<br>
These distinctions exist for good reason—I wouldn’t ask J. Robert Oppenheimer to extract my appendix, nor would I ask a surgeon to explain to me the finer points of theoretical physics.  
<br>
But to assume neither has anything to offer to the other’s field of expertise is counterproductive. 
<br>
While disciplines are rarely kept totally separate, we are invited to specialise more and more as we move through school, higher education and the workforce.  
<br>
By highlighting all the common ground shared by subject areas in research and current affairs, I hope to show that tackling the world’s most pressing challenges requires an interdisciplinary approach.
