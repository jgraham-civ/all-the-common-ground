<p>Our structures of education like to divide human knowledge into fields. These fields can be further subdivided; philosophy within the humanities, ethics within philosophy. The same applies to professional disciplines; consider a doctor specialising in surgery, or a mechanic specialising in aircraft. Indeed, our journeys through school, higher education and the workforce are typically ones of increasing specialisation.<p>

<p>This is for good reason—I wouldn’t ask J. Robert Oppenheimer to extract my appendix, nor would I ask a surgeon to design an atomic bomb.<p>

<p>But to assume neither has anything to offer to the other’s field of expertise is counterproductive.<p>

<p>By highlighting all the common ground shared by subject areas in research and current affairs, I hope to show that tackling the world’s most pressing challenges requires an interdisciplinary approach.<p>
